#Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

Script
==================================

The script used to tidy the data and calculate the averages is run_analysis.R

This script does the following:

1) Read the file features.txt in order to use it for naming the variables in the test and train datasets.

2) Read the file activity_labels.txt in order to use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the test and train datasets.

3) Read the test database (X_test) and add the column in the Y_test file.

4) Select only the variables with mean and std.

5) Add names to the activities using the file loaded in step 2


6) Do the steps 3 to 5, but with the train dataset.

7) Merges the train and test datasets. Create a variable called "database" that specifies whether the data comes from the test or the train dataset

8) Save the tidy dataset obtained in the 7

9) Obtain another dataset with the average  of each variable for each activity and each subject.

10) Save the dataset obtained in 9
